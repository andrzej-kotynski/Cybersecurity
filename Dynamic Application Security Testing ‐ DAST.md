## There are two ways of testing for security vulnerabilities

- Static Application Security Testing
- Dynamic Application Security Testing

## DAST is used for testing running applications

Processes associated with DAST:
- app crawling 
    - process of indexing data in an app by using a program or an automated script
    - ensures app's basic functionality with minimal configuration
    - it's possible to configure a crawler to issue specific inputs - text, numeric values, etc.
- application auditing
    - application analysis
- automated penetration testing
    - rapidly scans large applications 
    - creates a response and based on that identifies vulnerabilities like SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting
